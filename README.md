Core Template Studio is a .NET Standard 2.0 project that handles all of the template synchronization and code generation (composition, generation + postaction execution) for **[WindowsTemplateStudio](https://github.com/Microsoft/WindowsTemplateStudio)** and **[WebTemplateStudio](https://github.com/Microsoft/WebTemplateStudio)**. The main project has two parts: a .NET Standard core and its corresponding Cli that exposes the core. There's also a tools folder containing helper tools as the WtsPackagingTool.

## Branches
Our default branch is dev and all PR's should go to the dev branch. While there are no releases of CoreTS, we still have a release branch on CoreTS as this is where the submodules on Web Template Studio and Windows Template Studio point to. When adding new functionality or changing existing code make sure the changes are compatible with both Windows Template Studio and Web Template Studio. All changes have to be tested in both Windows Template Studio and Web Template Studio before being merged into the release branch.

## Documentation

- [Getting started with the codebase](./docs/getting-started-developers.md).

## Features

- _Synchronizes Templates_: The core has the ability to synchronize with templates, either in debug as a templates folder or in release as a .mstx file. It also builds and refreshes the template cache.
- _Provides information about available templates_: Upon synchronization, the core will provide information on the available project type, framework, page and feature templates.
- _Generate using Templates_: Using the available templates, the core does the composition, generation and postaction execution to create a C# or VB Project.
- _Telemetry_: Performs the majority of telemetry for Windows Template Studio including user selections and generation time.

## Limitations

- Currently .NET Standard does not support Package verification using PackageDigitalSignatureManager. This functionality was moved to the Utilities project (.NET framework) to be consumed from Windows Template Studio. The CLI (.NET Core 3.1) does not allow to download template packages from the CDN due to this limitation. Tracking issue for adding this in once it is supported is issue [#131](https://github.com/microsoft/CoreTemplateStudio/issues/131).

This project is a shared project and will change based on the needs of WindowsTemplateStudio and WebTemplateStudio. You can check out WindowsTemplateStudio's [roadmap](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsTemplateStudio/blob/dev/docs/roadmap.md) for more information. We're still working on a roadmap for WebTemplateStudio.
